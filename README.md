# AnimGroupsSA

***********************************************************************

Animation Association Extender for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas by ANTINICKNAMES.

Version date: 19.12.2025 (TEST VERSION)

***********************************************************************

DESCRIPTION:

Dis plugin allows u to add new animation group associations for weapons and more.

U'll find detailed instructions for use in the file 'How_To_Use.docx'!

Compatible with Fastman Limit Adjuster!


***********************************************************************

INSTALLATION:

Just drop files in game directory or in the scripts folder in game directory.


***********************************************************************

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Due to unspecified circumstances, the game's audio disappears after a while. I suspect this may be related to other plugins (including Stories.Sprinting), as I encountered this issue before creating this plugin, adding new pedestrian walkstyle animations to ANIMGRP.DAT, which works with the same association groups array as this mod.
